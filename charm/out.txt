Charm++> Running in SMP mode: 4 processes, 1 worker threads (PEs) + 0 comm threads per process, 4 PEs total
Charm++> There's no comm. thread. Work threads both send and receive messages
Converse/Charm++ Commit ID: v6.11.0-devel-420-gefc74ec
Charm++ built without optimization.
Do not use for performance benchmarking (build with --with-production to do so).
Charm++ built with internal error checking enabled.
Do not use for performance benchmarking (build without --enable-error-checking to do so).
